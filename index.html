<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Be The Best Dog Owner With These Tips And Tricks</h2><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<big>They say that a dog is man's best friend, and truer words have
never been spoken. If you are a dog owner, you know how loyal and
loving a dog can be. However, it is not enough just to love your dog.
You also know how to care for your dog properly. The following advice
will help.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You may know that chocolate is dangerous for dogs, but you may not know
the specifics. Chocolate is dangerous because of the stimulants
caffeine and theobromine. Baking chocolate is the most dangerous, with
a high amount of stimulants. White chocolate contains the least amount
of stimulants. Take you dog to vet if he ingests chocolate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep on top of fleas. Not only can fleas cause infection in your dog,
if one is swallowed, your pet can get tapeworms as well. Speak to your
veterinarian about the best prevention method, but remember that this
is not a one shot deal. You will have to continue your efforts over the
life of your pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a "wrinkly" dog, like a bulldog? If so, you have to be
conscientious about the grooming process in order to help keep your pet
clean. After you brush, take a baby wipe and use it to get in between
the folds on their body. Make sure, though, to get them fully dry after
doing so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have an outdoor <a href="https://bulldogs4.s3.eu-de.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/index.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">English bulldog</span></a>,
build a shelter for him or buy one that is ready to use. If his feet
are wet, extreme temperatures can be stressful and bad for his health.
Keep your dog safe from wind, rain and snow by providing it with a
house with lots of room and a dry floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When you are trimming your dog's nails, keep a close eye on the tips of
the nails. Once you see a pale oval on the tip, stop clipping. This is
a sign that you are close to the vein. If you go too far, apply a
little bit of styptic powder to it to help stop the bleeding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is very important for you to keep your dog's ears clean. Keeping the
inside of the ears clean will help prevent infections of the ear. This
is also a good time for you to inspect the ear for fleas, ticks and any
other pests that could have made your dog's ear home.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Dog training requires you to be consistent. Once you decide you want to
establish a rule for your dog, do not make any exceptions. Make sure
everyone at home helps you enforce the rule and encourage your guests
not to let your dog jump on them or to not acknowledge your dog when it
barks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Check to make sure your dog's collar is adjusted properly by fitting
two of your fingers comfortably underneath it and pulling gently. There
should be just enough room to do this and no more, otherwise he may be
able to wiggle out of it. Always keep it on, except during crate
transport, as the collar can get snagged and injure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your dog should not be left outside for the entire day. This is done
for various reasons, but your dog needs interaction with people. A dog
with no companions can feel very isolated and stressed out if he is
left alone outside. Also, they could be bitten by ticks, hurt by other
animals or even abducted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Certain dog breeds are prone to particular health issues, so find out
what is typical for the type of dog you have. Do what you can to combat
those issues early. Also, talk to your vet about things that can be
done to increase the odds for your dog's breed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are looking for dog of a particular breed, don't discount your
local pound. Many pet owners will abandon dogs at pounds when they
don't want them or can't keep them anymore. Contact the pound in your
area to see what kinds of breeds they have at the time. You may save a
poor dog's life if you do this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble training your dog, see a professional. A lot
of people wait until their problems are enormous, but if you would see
a dog trainer as soon as you start having difficulty, you will find
training goes more easily. Not only that, but you will save yourself a
major headache.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your female dog is in heat, be very careful with her around other
dogs or she may become pregnant. It is possible for a male to pick up
her scent from miles away. This can lead to aggression among other
males, and you certainly don't want to be left with an unexpected
litter of pups.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your dog needs healthy teeth and you should brush them regularly. This
helps to prevent dental problems and gum disease, but also prevents
other illnesses. Infections in the mouth can spread to other areas of
the dog's body, like the kidneys and the heart. Pet stores sell special
toothpaste for dogs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your dog is covering everything in the house with his shedding fur,
grab a paper towel. Lightly wet it with water and rub it down his back
in the direction of fur growth. The loose hair should come off easily
on the paper towel and your dog will love the attention too!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure that you buy an appropriate sized collar for your dog in
order to ensure its health and safety. If the collar is too lose, it
may become snagged on something. If the collar is too tight, it may
restrict the dog's breathing ability. Allow for a two finger space
between the dog and the collar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Never approach a <a href="https://bulldogs4.s3.eu-de.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">French Bulldog</span></a>
you are unfamiliar with. Teach your children the same thing. An
unfamiliar dog may look friendly, but he could have a vicious bite.
Even if he is not a biter, he might jump on you, potentially causing
harm. Always ask his owner for permission before approaching him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After reading this article, you should have a better understanding of
how to take care of your dog. By using this advice on a daily basis,
you can enjoy many years of companionship with your furry friend. Keep
your dog happy and healthy throughout its life by using these tips.</big><br />
